                            <em>Soteria</em>
                            (from Greek: “deliverance”)
                            <p>In Hellenistic religions, soteria referred to sacrifices or festivals commemorating or expecting deliverance from a crisis, often involving large-scale commemorative events held at planned intervals. Sixteen such festivals are known, the most famous being at Delphi, celebrating the defeat of the Celts in 279–278 BC.</p>
